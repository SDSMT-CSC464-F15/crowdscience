\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
\-Removes user info from session data if user logs out, and logs in user. \-This file establishes the connection to the database, and then verifies that the connection was successful. \-The data in the post message is retrieved and decrypted. \-The action from the post message is then used to perform an action to interact with the database or session data.

\-The default action returns a status of 1, indicating that an invalid action was supplied, and a message that no action was taken. \-When the action is logout, the username is removed from the session data, and the response status is set to 0. \-When the action is login, the function \hyperlink{login_8php_a0d3d3fe80a9fe8faa3320b29dbb2c29a}{validate\-User()} is called to check the user's submitted username and password against the records stored in the database.

\-The response is then encoded and returned to the \-Java\-Script that posted to this file.

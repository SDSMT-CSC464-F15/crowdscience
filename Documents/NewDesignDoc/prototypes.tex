\chapter{Prototypes}

This chapter records eaach prototype developed.  This section is a historical record of what was accomplished in the course of the project, organized according to Sprints.  This section contains the basic description of the sprint deliverable and what was accomplished.  

\section{Sprint 1 Prototype}
\subsection{Deliverable}
Rough draft of main page. See Figure~\ref{prototype_S1_main}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Backlog}
The backlog completed for this sprint was initial documentation, primarily including the requirements section of the design document; an analysis of the work done in the previous project, the Landscape Change Mapper; and creating a rough draft of the Crowd Science Mapper website.
\subsection{Success/Fail}
This sprint was a success, overall. No major issues arose.

\section{Sprint 2 Prototype}
\subsection{Deliverable}
Updated main page, added login and register features. See Figure~\ref{prototype_S2_main}, Figure~\ref{prototype_S2_login}, and Figure~\ref{prototype_S2_register}.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Backlog}
The backlog completed for this sprint was a completed analysis of original project, the LCM; expansion on the original draft to include login and register page layouts; transporting code from LCM project for login and register pages and adapting the code for our project; and more work on the requirements, project, and mission/elevator sections.
\subsection{Success/Fail}
This sprint was a success, overall. No major issues arose.

\section{Sprint 3 Prototype}
\subsection{Deliverable}
There were no changes to the deliverable of Sprint 2.
\subsection{Backlog}
The backlog completed for this sprint was work on the requirements section and overview section. 
\subsection{Success/Fail}
This sprint was a roaring failure, overall. Following the client presentation on 10/27/2015, Jiasong entirely ceased contributing to the project and attending team meetings. The features planned to be added to the prototype, submitting a report and viewing a list of reports; were not added to the prototype.

\section{Sprint 4 Prototype}
\subsection{Deliverable}
Added event set selection to main page, added feilds to register page. See Figure~\ref{prototype_S4_main}, Figure~\ref{prototype_S4_selectbox}, and Figure~\ref{prototype_S4_register}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Backlog}
Backlog completed this sprint was a revision of of project requirements, deliverables, project overview, and team information; the addition of several collections to the database, to contain event reports, user information, and event report set information; and the implementation of a selection box to switch between event report sets.
\subsection{Success/Fail}
This sprint was a roaring success, overall. Early in the sprint, Jiasong Yan was removed from the team, and the project was adjusted accordingly. Project revisions went smoothly, and two major components added to the prototype.

\section{Sprint 5 Prototype}
\subsection{Deliverable}
Added map of events, event photos carousel, and event reports table to main page, shown here with data from the Landscape Change event set. See Figure~\ref{prototype_S5_main}, Figure~\ref{prototype_S5_table},  Figure~\ref{prototype_S5_map}, and  Figure~\ref{prototype_S5_imagecarousel}.  Added reporting interface, closeup images shown with fields corresponding to the Landscape Change event set, and an overall image shown with fields corresponding to the Bird Sighting event set. See Figure~\ref{prototype_S5_report_1}, Figure~\ref{prototype_S5_report_2}, and Figure~\ref{prototype_S5_report}. Added interface to view single event. See Figure~\ref{prototype_S5_view}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Backlog}
Backlog completed this sprint was primarily in the form of prototype features added: implementation of event reports table, event reports map, and event set photo carousel on the main page; implementation of reporting interface specific to each event set; and interface to view an individual event. In addition, photos associated with events were also added to the database.
\subsection{Success/Fail}
The sprint was an overall sucess.  The prototype is essentially finished, no major changes should be needed. Documentation fell behind this sprint.

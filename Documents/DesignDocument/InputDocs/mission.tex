\section{Elevator Pitch}
Crowd Science (also known as Citizen Science) aims at soliciting ideas, findings, and information to support scientific research, which could reduce time and cost for data acquisition and enhance the accuracy and generality of research results. This project was inspired by USGS Did You Feel It (DYFI) project, USGS Butterflies and Moths of North America (BAMONA) project, and Cornellâ€™s eBird project.

The Crowd Science Mapper will be a generic crowdsourcing website, where ordinary citizens can report events such as butterfly or bird sightings, and view these events. Administrators in this system will be able to approve individual events and modify event sets, with no programming experience using a graphical user interface.

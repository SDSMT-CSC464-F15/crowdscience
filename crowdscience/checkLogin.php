		This file will start a session if one has not already been started, and then check to see if there is a username stored in that session. If one is stored, then the status is set to zero, and the status and session username are encoded for javascript and returned to the javascript when the php script has finished. If there is no username stored in the session data, a status of one is encoded and returned to the javascript.

		\file event.php
		\brief Handles event data to and from the database.
		\details
		This file establishes the connection to the database, and then verifies that the connection was successful. The data in the post message is retrieved and decrypted. If a session has not been started, a new session is started. The action from the post message is then used call a function to interact with the database. Each function will save the status code to the response, in addition to the results of the database query. 
		
		The default action returns a status of 1, indicating that an invalid action was supplied, and a message that no action was taken. When the action is updateoptions, updateEventSetOptions() is called, which retrieves the information necessary to repopulate the event set selection box. The action changeselection calls changeEventSetSelection(), which stores the new event set selection to session data. The action geteventsetinfo calls getEventSetInfo(), which retrieves all the event set information necessary to display the selected event set data. The action geteventsetdata calls getEventSetData(), which retrieves all event set data for the selected event set. The action geteventsetinfoanddata calls getEventSetInfoAndData, which performs the actions of both getEventSetData() and getEventSetInfo(), this function is implemented because the response data is not correctly assembled separately in the two functions and database queries are streamlined when combined. The action geteventsetinfoandeventbyid calls the getEventSetInfoAndEventByID(), which retrieves the data for a single event, referenced by the ID supplied in the request.
		
		The response is then encoded and returned to the JavaScript that posted to this file.

		\brief Retrieves the data for a single event, referenced by the ID supplied in the request.

		This function retrieves the selected event set from the session data, and then creates a reference to the database table corresponding to that event set. Then, references to the table of information about the event sets and the table containing user information are also established. The database is then queried using the Mongo database findOne() function, to retrieve the event set details information from the event set information table. If the information retrieved from the database is null, the response status is set to 2, and an error message is added to the response, and the function returns. The details of the event set information are then added to the response. Then the Mongo database is queried with the id of the event report being retrieved. If the query returns null, the response status is set to 3, and error message is added to the response, and the function returns. The user table in the database is then queried to retrieve the username of the author of the event report. If this query fails, the response status is set to 1, an error message is added to the response, and the function returns. The username then replaces the user field in the event report array retrieved from the database. The date of the event report is then parsed into a human readable date and saved in the event report. The event is added to the response, the status is then set to 0, indicating no errors, and the response is returned from the function.
